# Swarm Control
Swarm Control is a simple application designed to automate the scaling of swarm services. It utilizes a threshold stored in a SQLite database to manage up and down scaling.

Additionally, the application features a user-friendly web interface that allows for manual scaling of services.

# TODO

- Implement a web interface for setting high and low thresholds.
- Refactor the codebase for improved performance and maintainability.
